Hello! This is my first project that I'm going to work on based on all the materials that I've learned through Odin Project so far.
It's very exciting to finally apply what I've learned as it is also my first try putting up a website (the source of it, at least).

As the title of this repository saids, this project is about making a webpage that looks the same as the screen that pops up when "google.com" is opened in a browser. Hopefully I'll be able to do this without too much trouble.
