Hello! This is my first project that I'm going to work on based on all the materials that I've learned through Odin Project so far.
It's very exciting to finally apply what I've learned as it is also my first try putting up a website (the source of it, at least).

As the title of this repository saids, this project is about making a webpage that looks the same as the screen that pops up when "google.com" is opened in a browser. Hopefully I'll be able to do this without too much trouble.

Also, I used Eric Meyer's reset css, named as reset.css in the file

-2018.01.25: Began project
--Did not know I had to get as much done as possible before looking into the inspector.
Unfortunately I got some exact values of some of the attributes, for example the padding and margin
of the top navigation bar and the "Google" logo. I did stop reading the inspector mid-way. The search bar and the bottom navigation bar was done without getting info from inspector.
--Looking at the inspectors, there are a lot of "div" tags, and bunch of selectors. Really a lot of
abbreviated names of selectors. Crazy amount.
--I accidentally searched something on my fake webpage. lol
--I did get my webpage to somewhat look like the original, although there are few exceptions:
1. I used <input type="text"> for the searchbar, and <input type="button" for the two buttons below
the searchbar. It looks slightly different from the original website, and by looking at the inspector
I have a guess that the original uses other type of input for the searchbar and the button.
2. I failed to get the image for three elements at the top navigation bar. I temporarily replaced them with a word describing what the image looks like. I looked in the inspector to retrieve the url for the image, but I got an image which had bunch of other images including the one I wanted to use. Have to find out how I can use this type of image.
3. I feel like I can tidy up my codes better, for example, all anchor elements are underlined when a mouse hovers over, but I have two hover selectors doing the same thing.
